Once you've cloned this repo and checked out the embedded-python-framework branch, you'll need to provide a copy of a relocatable Python framework.

Use this project to make one:
https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python

Copy the resulting framework into Imagr/Resources

Open the Imagr.xcodeproj in Xcode and build the project.
